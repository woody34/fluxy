# What is Fluxy?

Fluxy is a very simple store that allows Deno Fresh islands to communicate using
hooks.

# Examples

Take a look at the following files in
[this](https://github.com/woody34/fluxy-fresh) repo for implementation
reference.

```sh
├── hooks
│   └── useToaster.ts
├── islands
│   ├── ShowToastButton.tsx
│   └── Toast.tsx
└── routes
    └── _app.tsx
```
